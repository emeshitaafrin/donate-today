                <p>Familiar foods are important. They lift morale and give a feeling of security in times of stress. We try to include foods that they will enjoy and that are also high in calories and nutrition. Foods that require no refrigeration, water, special preparation, or cooking are best.</p>

                <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                <p>Flood shelters are generally made of concrete because they are easy to construct, strong and cost efficient. They are elevated on strong pillars with a deep foundation designed to withstand high winds, water levels, and potentially scour, in high flow environments.</p>

                <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                <p>The psychological impact of natural disasters can hinder a student's ability to perform well in school. After a natural disaster, survivors have shown symptoms similar to post- traumatic stress disorder which can last up to five years following the disaster and decrease academic performance.</p>
